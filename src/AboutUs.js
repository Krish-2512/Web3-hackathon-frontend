//                     <p>Our mission is to make the handling of digital Identities more secure and verified using blockchain technology.
//                         We aim to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution 
//                            that empowers individuals to have control over their own digital identities.
//                                 The utilisation of blockchain technology allows us to enhance the validity and trust on the verification of documents. As once a document is verified and stored on blockchain further no tampering can be done to it.
//                                                   We utilise the well secured IPFS system for document verification.We provide you with the facility of utilising all these beneficial functionalitites sitting at home.                                 </p>
